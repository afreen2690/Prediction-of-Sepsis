# Sepsis Prediction Model

## Problem Statement & Method
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its tissues and organs. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates associated with sepsis. However, accurately identifying patients at risk of developing sepsis remains challenging due to the complexity of its clinical presentation and the rapid progression of the condition.

To address this issue, we propose developing a predictive model capable of accurately identifying patients at risk of developing sepsis. Our methodology involves two main steps: feature importance analysis and predictive modeling. 

1. **Feature Importance Analysis**: We will utilize machine learning models such as **Random Forest** or **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to ascertain the most influential clinical variables contributing to sepsis prediction. This analysis will provide critical insights into which factors are most indicative of sepsis development, aiding in understanding the underlying physiological mechanisms.

2. **Predictive Modeling**: Following feature analysis, we will develop a predictive model using **Logistic Regression** to forecast whether a patient will develop sepsis. Logistic regression is known for its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks, making it suitable for practical implementation in clinical settings.

Our primary objective is to develop a precise predictive model that offers invaluable insights into the onset of sepsis, facilitating proactive interventions and optimal patient care and management.

## Data
For our project, we will utilize the **Kaggle dataset** sourced from **PhysioNet**, specifically the **Prediction of Sepsis** dataset. This repository comprises a diverse array of clinical data, encompassing vital signs, laboratory results, and demographic information essential for our predictive modeling endeavor. 

- **Dataset Details**:
  - **Number of Columns**: Approximately 44
  - **Number of Rows**: 1,552,210
  - **Source**: [Kaggle Sepsis Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salikhussaini49/prediction-of-sepsis)

This openly accessible dataset provides a robust foundation for our analysis and modeling efforts.
